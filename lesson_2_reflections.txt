What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

If we do it alone we can overdo or underdo it, and we can also forget to do it, but we can do it whenever we feel like we need it to,

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can't just imagine it in my head so drawing diagrams helps me with realizing its structure.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

As in all cases, when it comes to automatic we make sure that the merging is done, but we dont know if it will be done at a time when it is too late or too early, but when we do that manually we can assure that we do it at the right time, but we can also forget to do it.
